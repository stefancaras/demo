                <p id="p1">As the name implies, these frogs are typically found in trees or other high-growing vegetation. 
                    They do not normally descend to the ground, except to mate and spawn, 
                    though some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees at all as adults.

                    </p>
                <p id="p2">Tree frogs are usually tiny as their weight has to be carried by the branches and twigs in their habitats. 
                    While some reach 10 cm (4 in) or more, they are typically smaller and more slender than terrestrial frogs. 
                    Tree frogs typically have well-developed discs at the finger and toe tips; the fingers and toes themselves, 
                    as well as the limbs, tend to be rather small, resulting in a superior grasping ability. 
                    The genus Chiromantis of the Rhacophoridae is most extreme in this respect: 
                    it can oppose two fingers to the other two, resulting in a vise-like grip.</p>

                <p id="p3">The dorsal (upper) surface of the bullfrog has an olive-green basal color, 
                    either plain or with mottling and banding of grayish brown. 
                    The ventral (under) surface is off-white blotched with yellow or gray. 
                    Often, a marked contrast in color is seen between the green upper lip and the pale lower lip. 
                    The teeth are tiny and are useful only in grasping.[12] The eyes are prominent with brown irises and horizontal, 
                    almond-shaped pupils. 
                    The tympana (eardrums) are easily seen just behind the eyes and the dorsolateral folds of skin enclose them. 
                    The limbs are blotched or banded with gray. 
                    The fore legs are short and sturdy and the hind legs long. 
                    The front toes are not webbed, but the back toes have webbing between the digits with the exception of the fourth toe, 
                    which is unwebbed.
                    <p id="p4">Bullfrogs are sexually dimorphic, with males being smaller than females and having yellow throats. Males have tympana larger than their eyes, whereas the tympana in females are about the same size as the eyes.[11] Bullfrogs measure about 3.6 to 6 in (9 to 15 cm) in snout–to–vent length. They grow fast in the first eight months of life, typically increasing in weight from 5 to 175 g (0.18 to 6.17 oz),[13] and large, mature individuals can weigh up to 500 g (1.1 lb).[14] In some cases bullfrogs have been recorded as attaining 800 g (1.8 lb) and measuring up to 8 in (20 cm) from snout to vent. The American bullfrog is the largest species of frog in North America</p>

                <p id="p5">The frog spends most of its life underground and surfaces only during the monsoon, 
                    for a period of two weeks, for mating. 
                    With few field scientists out in the field during the rainy season, 
                    the species was discovered and studied only in recent times. 
                    Males emerge to call beside temporary rainwater streams. 
                    They mount females and grip them (amplexus) along the vertebral column. 
                    Around 3000 eggs are laid in a rock pool and the tadpoles metamorphose after around 100 days.

                    Unlike many other burrowing species of frogs that emerge and feed above the ground, this species has been found to forage underground, feeding mainly on termites using its tongue and a special buccal groove.[14]
                    
                    In 2015, tadpoles of the species were discovered to be traditionally consumed by tribal communities</p>

                <p id="p7">Male orange-thighed frogs congregate around still ponds, 
                    and call from low branches, or the edges of the water. 
                    The call is a long "aaa-rk", followed by a soft trill. 
                    They call after heavy monsoon rains. 
                    The males call in a large chorus; 
                    amplexus occurs where the frog calls, 
                    and the male and female move to the laying site. 
                    The eggs are brown, and are in masses of 800 to 1600. 
                    The tadpoles are identical in appearance to those of the red-eyed tree frog.

                <p id="p9">Green frogs are commonly found sitting on the shore line pointed towards the water. 
                    If approached, the frog will quickly jump into the water and either swim 
                    to the bottom or float at the surface with only their eyes out. 
                    This species is usually diurnal, although they are active at night when temperatures are warm.
                </p>
                <p id="p10">Green frogs start to awaken once daytime temperatures rise above 10 °C (50 °F), 
                    though they will not breed until temperatures are consistently warm.
                    
                    Tadpoles are detritivores that sift through the substrate looking for morsels. 
                    Tadpoles consume decaying plant matter and will also feed on dead animals such as frogs that drowned. 
                    Tadpoles can be found sunning themselves in shallow water, retreating into deeper water when disturbed. 
                    They are active during the winter and can be seen moving around under the ice.
